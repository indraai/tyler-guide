The 2006 $100,000 Singularity Challenge, a fundraiser in which Peter Thiel matches donations up to $100,000, takes place. The fundraiser successfully matches the $100,000 amount. This would mark the beginning of Peter Thiel (and later, the Thiel Foundation) playing an important role in funding MIRI, which it would continue to do till 2015.

OpenCog is founded "via a grant from the [MIRI], and the donation from Novamente LLC of a large body of software code and software designs developed during the period 2001–2007". Ben Goertzel directs MIRI work on OpenCog; his work at MIRI is limited to work on OpenCog-related projects. Through funding from the Google Summer of Code, 11 interns get to work on the project in the summer of 2008. After the departure of Tyler Emerson and MIRI's deemphasis of OpenCog, Goertzel would step down as research director in 2010.

> OpenCog has received funding and support from several sources, including the Hong Kong government, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation and Hanson Robotics.

### What’s going on here?
Consider Thiel’s massive investment in cryptocurrencies (EOS, Bitcoin, and possibly Ethereum), as well as artificial intelligence and surveillance over blockchain (Palantir).

Now, take another look at the title of Jordan Peterson’s video announcing he and Dave Rubin’s new platform to replace Patreon, Patreon: Problem & Solution.

### Problem
Patreon moved against their own financial interests to politically target friends of the intellectual dark web, bizarrely using the term “manifest observable behaviour” (MOB rule) to explain their decisions, i.e. Jack was cucked by his owners. Information is leaked to show that payment processors are putting political pressure on the likes of Patreon—the banks have too much power!

### Reaction
The intellectual dark web step into action, declaring the move a violation of free speech. They make a huge hubbub as they leave the platform, encouraging their patrons and other “creators” to follow.

### Solution
Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson create a new platform that incorporates a cryptocurrency technology. As a result, blockchain and crypto technologies are brought to a mainstream audience. Investment in these technologies increases and blockchain technologies supporting AI and global surveillance see accelerated growth. Peter Thiel (a member of the Bilderberg steering committee) makes a ton more money and keeps his Bilderberg colleagues satiated, as they focus on the key topics, “Artificial intelligence” and “The Trans-Atlantic defence alliance: bullets, bytes and bucks”.

SEAN PARKER is an American entrepreneur and philanthropist who co-founded the file-sharing computer service Napster and served as the first president of the social networking website Facebook. He is the founder and chairman of the Parker Foundation, which focuses on life sciences, global public health, and civic engagement.

As a teenager, Parker's hobbies were hacking and programming. One night, while hacking into the network of a Fortune 500 company, Parker was unable to log out after his father had confiscated his computer keyboard. Because his IP address was exposed, F.B.I. agents tracked down the 16-year-old.

As president, Parker brought on Thiel as Facebook's first investor.

While working at Founders Fund, Parker had been looking to invest in a company that could further Napster's music sharing mission legally.

In 2006, Parker became managing partner at Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund founded by Peter Thiel.

In 2001 Sean Parker was already attending Edge.org dinners with Marvin Minsky and Martha Stewart.
